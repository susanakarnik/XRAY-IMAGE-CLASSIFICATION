# XRAY-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION
This is a machine learning based project which can predict whether a person is suffering from pneumonia disease or not just by analysing his/her x-ray image of chest. I trained it on thousands of x-ray images and it gave outstanding accuracy around 99.8 % on testing images.
